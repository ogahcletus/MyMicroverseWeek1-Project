# Hello Microverse

> In this project, I am required to set up a "Hello Microverse" repository. No complex coding is required for this exercise. The goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices I learned about in previous steps. I am will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well, so it is important to know them!
